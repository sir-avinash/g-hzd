The MATLAB code files are used to in section of inverted pendulum cart example. All optimization, simulation and plot the referred in the paper are included here.

The authors run MATLAB version R2016a, any high version should compatible with the Simulink.

The main body is in the "Pendulum-on-a-cart" folder. Run setpath.m to begin. 

Simulation:

simFullOrderModel.m and simReduceOrderController.m are running simulation in Simulink and generate data for plotting. One can find the controller inside the Simulink to change to different controllers.

Optimization:

optimDisturb.m and optimOrbit.m are used to generate trajectory optimization. The trajectories are saved in "DataFiles" folder that ready to generate controller using Supervised Machine Learning.

Controller Design:

In "util", ParseOptim.m and ParseOptimFull.m are used to generate controller using Neural Network. Depends on the trajectories given from optimzation, different controllers can be generated in the same way.

The controller will then be saved in "controller" folder. It will be used for simulation.

Plot:

All plot are generated from "plot" folder.
