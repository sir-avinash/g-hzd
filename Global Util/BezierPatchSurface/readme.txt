---------------------------------------
Unzip the archive, add to current working directory and run the main.m program
Following files are included in the archive:

main.m
A simple test program to construct a Bezier surface for given set of control points. The Bezier surface is composed of 32 patches.

bezierpatchinterp.m
A function to evaluate cubic Bezier patch for given set of 16 control points. It returns interpolated points.

plotbezierpatch3D.m
A function to plot cubic Bezier patch for given set of 16 control points and interpolated points.

plotbeziersurface3D.m
A function to plot cubic Bezier surface (one or more patches) for given set of control points and interpolated points for each patch.

teapot.mat
Data file that contains control points for 3D surface teapot.  The surface composed of 32 patches. Each patch has 16 control points. Each control point has three values (x,y,z)
